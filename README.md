# ScalableXplain üöÄ  
**An XAI Library Supporting Both Single-Node and Distributed Systems**

ScalableXplain is a versatile explainable AI (XAI) library that provides unified support for both **single-node** (e.g., pandas/numpy-based) and **distributed** (PySpark-based) machine learning environments. It is designed to scale explanations from your laptop to large cloud clusters with minimal code changes.

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ **Single-node support** (Python, pandas, numpy)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Distributed support** using **PySpark**
- üìä **Low-code plotting** for explanations on both local and distributed data
- üß† Supports popular XAI techniques:
  - `KernelSHAP`
  - `LIME`
  - `Iterative Mistake Minimization (IMM)` for explaining clustering models
