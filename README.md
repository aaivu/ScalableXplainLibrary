# ScalableXplain 🚀  
**An XAI Library Supporting Both Single-Node and Distributed Systems**

ScalableXplain is a versatile explainable AI (XAI) library that provides unified support for both **single-node** (e.g., pandas/numpy-based) and **distributed** (PySpark-based) machine learning environments. It is designed to scale explanations from your laptop to large cloud clusters with minimal code changes.
